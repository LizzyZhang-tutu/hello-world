# hello-world

Hello, this is Lizzy Zhang, I have just started learning computer science at the University of Waterloo.
My first time here at github.
I am now a beginner to python, c#, html, css and javascript. I followed 2 projects of Unity 3D. Now I'm trying to build my own blog using so far learnt web-developing knowledge.
